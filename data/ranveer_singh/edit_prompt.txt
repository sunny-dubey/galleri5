Replace the young man in this outdoor portrait with Ranveer Singh, maintaining the exact same pose, body orientation, and head position. Preserve the neutral, contemplative expression with his gaze directed towards the left side of the frame. Ensure Ranveer Singh is wearing the same plain, short-sleeved, dusty pink crew-neck t-shirt. Maintain the exact same soft, natural outdoor lighting that evenly illuminates the face, the blurred green foliage background with hints of light blue sky, and the shallow depth of field. Keep the medium close-up composition with the subject slightly off-center to the right, looking into the empty space on the left. The replacement should feature Ranveer Singh with wavy hair and trimmed beard (consistent with his appearance in training data entries 003, 020, 021, 024, 025, 026, 028, 030, 031, 032, 039, 041, 047), seamlessly integrated into the original scene while preserving all environmental details, camera angle, and the casual, natural aesthetic of the outdoor portrait.
